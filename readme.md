### Categories

Categories has many projects.

### Tags

Tags are linked to projects and use [Select2](http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/) js plugin.  
It has many to many polymorphic relations so it could easily be linked to other modules.

Users registration can be enable through the settings panel (/admin/settings).

### Translations

Translations can be store in database through the admin panel (/admin/translations).  
Each cell of the translation table is editable in place.

You can call DB translation everywhere with ``` Lang::get('db.Key') ```, ``` trans('db.Key') ``` or ``` @lang('db.Key') ```.

### Settings

Change website title, and other options trough the settings panel. Settings are saved in database.
